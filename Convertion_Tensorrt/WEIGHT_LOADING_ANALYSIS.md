# Weight Loading Analysis for MatchAnything TensorRT Conversion

## Introduction

Converting the MatchAnything model (specifically the matchanything_roma variant) to an ONNX/TensorRT engine has encountered issues: the exported ONNX and TensorRT engine files are unexpectedly small, suggesting that large portions of the model’s weights (notably the DINOv2 ViT backbone) were not properly included. This analysis examines the Python scripts in the `Convertion_Tensorrt` directory – including the main conversion module and various weight-mapping utilities – to identify which functions are correctly implemented, which are flawed or redundant, and how to fix the weight-loading so that the full model (especially DINOv2’s weights) is incorporated. We cross-reference the design of MatchAnything (and its RoMa variant) and DINOv2 to explain the needed adjustments. Clear recommendations are provided on which scripts/functions to keep or improve, which to remove, and how to modify the code to ensure the ONNX contains all weights for accurate inference.

## Overview of Conversion Scripts and Functions

The TensorRT conversion branch contains several scripts aimed at exporting the MatchAnything model to ONNX and building a TensorRT engine. Key components include:

- **`accurate_matchanything_trt.py`** – Defines the `AccurateMatchAnythingTRT` model class and an export function. This wraps the MatchAnything model (ROMA variant) with TensorRT-friendly modules. It instantiates a combined encoder (`CNNandDinov2TRT`) and a matching head (`GPMatchEncoderTRT`), and it provides `export_accurate_matchanything_onnx()` to export the model to ONNX.
- **Weight Adapter Utilities** – A series of scripts to load the PyTorch checkpoint into the `AccurateMatchAnythingTRT` model by remapping weight keys:
  - `weight_adapter.py` (base version, used by default in the export function) – Contains `remap_and_load()` (not shown here) invoked in the exporter. This presumably applies simple regex rules to align the checkpoint keys with the model’s state dict.
  - `better_weight_adapter.py` – An improved version with more mapping rules and verbose diagnostics. It defines `better_remap_and_load()` which prints the count of keys in checkpoint vs model and analyzes key prefixes. It applies mapping rules to strip unwanted prefixes and rename segments, then loads matching tensors. It specifically reports how many DINOv2 weights are available vs needed and prints missing ones. For example, it will list "[BETTER] Missing DINOv2 weights…" if some DINO keys don’t map.
  - `improved_weight_adapter.py` – A more comprehensive adapter. It defines `apply_improved_mapping()` with extensive regex rules covering the MatchAnything checkpoint structure (e.g. mapping `matcher.model.decoder.embedding_decoder.*` to `encoder.dino.*`). After applying rules to remap all keys, it attempts to load all matching weights. Crucially, it then performs suffix matching on any remaining unmatched keys – this catches cases like DINOv2 transformer block names that differ only by an inserted index (explained below). It prints a summary of how many weights were loaded in total.
  - `fixed_weight_adapter.py` – Another variant focusing on the DINOv2 block naming issue. It provides `fix_dino_block_structure()` to explicitly insert an extra `.0` in DINO transformer block keys (e.g. converting `encoder.dino.blocks.0.norm1.weight` to `encoder.dino.blocks.0.0.norm1.weight`). The `apply_fixed_mapping()` function first runs this block fix on the checkpoint keys, then applies a set of regex mappings for other parts (CNN layers, matcher, etc.), and finally loads matching weights into the model. It reports how many weights (including how many DINO keys) were loaded and if any are missing.
- **Checkpoint Conversion Scripts** – These create modified checkpoint files by merging or adapting weights:
  - `checkpoint_adapted_model.py` – A one-off script that loads the original checkpoint and applies mappings based on insights from the papers (e.g. treating the `embedding_decoder` module as the DINOv2 ViT). It prints out how many `embedding_decoder` keys were found (signifying DINOv2’s presence), applies mappings (similar to improved adapter), and attempts to load the model. It flags if many DINO weights are still missing and hints that a block index mismatch might be the cause. In fact, it explicitly checks for missing DINO keys and prints a warning “⚠️ Many DINOv2 weights missing. Checking block structure…”, showing an example of the model’s expected key vs checkpoint key (with or without the extra index). This script thus confirms the known pitfall: the checkpoint’s DINO keys have a different block naming structure than the model expects.
  - `create_hybrid_checkpoint.py` – A utility that combines the original MatchAnything checkpoint with DINOv2’s official weights to produce a “hybrid” checkpoint. It loads the original checkpoint (which contains the MatchAnything-specific weights and transformer blocks of DINOv2), then loads a pre-trained DINOv2 ViT-L/14 model via TIMM. It copies all original weights into a new dict, then overwrites/adds essential DINOv2 components like `cls_token`, `pos_embed`, `patch_embed.*`, and `mask_token` from the DINOv2 model (with necessary resizing). Notably, it adapts DINOv2’s positional embedding from the 518×518 training resolution (1370 tokens) to a 224×224 resolution (197 tokens) by interpolating the spatial part down to 14×14 and concatenating the class token. It then processes all transformer block weights from the original (keys containing `embedding_decoder.blocks.X`) and renames them to the expected format: e.g. `matcher.model.decoder.embedding_decoder.blocks.5.mlp.fc1.weight` becomes `encoder.dino.blocks.5.0.mlp.fc1.weight` (inserting “.0” after the block index). This yields a hybrid state dict that has both the original keys and the new correctly named `encoder.dino.*` keys. The script saves this as `matchanything_roma_hybrid.ckpt` and even tests loading it into the model, reporting how many total weights and DINO weights load successfully (in practice, almost all should load, with any unmatched original-key entries simply ignored as unexpected).
  - `fix_dino_quick.py` – A simpler approach to produce a “complete” checkpoint. It downloads the full DINOv2 ViT-L/14 weights via TIMM, loads the original MatchAnything checkpoint, and then blindly combines them: it copies all original weights into a new dict, then for every DINO weight, it inserts it under the key prefixed with `encoder.dino.`. The result is saved as `matchanything_roma_complete.ckpt`. Essentially, this dumps an entire DINOv2 state dict into the MatchAnything checkpoint namespace without attempting to resolve structural differences. (It relies on a subsequent loading procedure, e.g. using `fixed_weight_adapter.py`, to handle renaming or dropping of unmatched keys.)

Finally, the directory includes shell scripts (e.g. `build_improved_tensorrt.sh`) that orchestrate the conversion steps. For instance, the improved script calls the Python export (with a `--ckpt` argument to use a checkpoint path) and then runs TensorRT’s `trtexec`. It addresses some practical pitfalls, like aligning image dimensions to multiples of 14 (the DINOv2 patch size) for dynamic shape ranges, and it reminds the user to keep ONNX external data files together.

## Analysis of Functions: Good vs. Flawed vs. Redundant

### 1. AccurateMatchAnythingTRT and ONNX Export (`accurate_matchanything_trt.py`)

**Assessment:** The design of the `AccurateMatchAnythingTRT` class and its `export_accurate_matchanything_onnx()` function is fundamentally sound. The class correctly wraps the MatchAnything/ROMA model components: it instantiates the combined encoder (a CNN plus DINOv2 trunk) and the matcher head when `model_name=="matchanything_roma"`. It also reproduces the original preprocessing (e.g. image resizing logic) and postprocessing (scaling matches to full resolution) exactly, ensuring functional equivalence with the original PyTorch implementation. This is important for accuracy, and these helper methods (`process_resize`, `resize_image`) are implemented as verbatim copies of the original (which is good). The ONNX export function sets up dynamic axes for the two input images and the variable-number output matches, and uses a high opset with external data format enabled to allow large model export. In short, the model definition and export scaffolding are good and should be kept.

**Issue:** The real problem is weight loading before export. Currently, `export_accurate_matchanything_onnx()` tries to load the checkpoint if provided, by calling `remap_and_load` from `weight_adapter.py`. If that fails to load anything, it falls back to a direct `model.load_state_dict(..., strict=False)` as a last resort. In practice, the default `weight_adapter.remap_and_load` was insufficient for this model’s checkpoint (it likely loaded the CNN and matcher weights but not most of DINO’s), leading to the situation where the DINOv2 backbone remained at random initialization. The ONNX export still proceeded, but with essentially random or zeroed ViT weights, making the ONNX file size tiny and the model ineffective. Thus, the export function logic is fine, but the weight-loading call inside it needs improvement (see Recommendations below).

### 2. Base Weight Adapter (`weight_adapter.remap_and_load`)

**Assessment:** The original `remap_and_load` (from `weight_adapter.py`) appears to have been an initial attempt to map checkpoint keys to the model. Although we don’t see its code here, we infer it applied some basic prefix-stripping (like removing `module.` or `_orig_mod.` if present) and perhaps mapping `matcher.model.` to nothing. Evidently this was not enough – otherwise the later “better” and “improved” adapters wouldn’t have been created. Indeed, in the export log, it printed a warning that no weights were loaded and proceeded to the fallback loading. So, `remap_and_load` was flawed/incomplete: it did not account for the complex nesting of the DINO backbone inside the checkpoint. This function can be considered redundant now given the newer adapters; we should replace it with the improved approach.

### 3. Better Weight Adapter (`better_remap_and_load`)

**Assessment:** The “better” adapter in `better_weight_adapter.py` added more mappings and detailed logging. It correctly removes wrapping prefixes (`module.`, `_orig_mod.`) and maps major parts of the hierarchy: e.g. `matcher.model.encoder.cnn.layers.* -> encoder.layers.*`, `matcher.model.encoder.* -> encoder.*`, `matcher.model.decoder.* -> matcher.*`. Importantly, it does leave any existing `encoder.dino.*` keys untouched by mapping them to themselves (the rule `^encoder\.dino\.` -> `encoder.dino.` is effectively a no-op). This suggests the author assumed that if the checkpoint already had keys starting with `encoder.dino.`, they should carry over – but in the actual checkpoint, DINO weights were under `matcher.model.decoder.embedding_decoder.*`, not `encoder.dino`, so this rule didn’t come into play. The function then attempts to load all exact-matching keys and prints how many matched. It specifically checks DINOv2 keys: how many were available in the mapped checkpoint vs how many the model expects, and how many actually got loaded. This is very useful for diagnosis – in fact, using this, one would have seen that most of the DINO keys were “available” in the checkpoint (after mapping) but zero were matched to the model. The code prints the first 10 missing DINO keys for inspection. This diagnostic confirmed that a naming mismatch (likely the missing “.0” in block names) was preventing loads. However, `better_remap_and_load` does not attempt to fix those mismatches; it simply reports them. Thus, while it’s a good diagnostic tool, it is flawed as a complete solution – it still leaves the DINO weights unloaded. It served as a stepping stone in development, but is now largely redundant (its core functionality is subsumed by the improved adapter, which also prints similar info).

### 4. Improved Weight Adapter (`apply_improved_mapping`)

**Assessment:** The improved adapter is a significant step forward. It includes comprehensive regex rules for the checkpoint structure, notably:

- Stripping wrappers (`module.`, `_orig_mod.`).
- Recognizing the `embedding_decoder`: mapping `matcher.model.decoder.embedding_decoder.*` to `encoder.dino.*`. This directly targets the DINOv2 backbone weights, which is critical. (It also covers variations like if the key started with just `embedding_decoder.` or `decoder.embedding_decoder.` in case the nesting is different.)
- Mapping CNN encoder and matcher keys similarly to the better adapter.

After applying all these rules, `apply_improved_mapping` builds a mapped weight dict and then tries to load every model key from it. What it can’t load due to shape mismatches, it prints as “[IMPROVED] Shape mismatch” (for instance, the positional embedding likely triggers this). Then, crucially, it tackles the remaining unmatched keys with a suffix-based heuristic. This is designed exactly to catch the DINO block naming issue: for each model key not yet loaded, it takes the last two name components (e.g. for `encoder.dino.blocks.5.0.attn.qkv.weight`, the suffix would be “attn.qkv.weight”), and tries to find a checkpoint key (in the mapped dict) that ends with the same suffix. In our case, the checkpoint (mapped) might have `encoder.dino.blocks.5.attn.qkv.weight` (missing the “.0”). The suffix “attn.qkv.weight” will match, and if the tensor shapes agree, it logs a “[IMPROVED] Suffix match: ... -> ...” message and adds that weight to the loadable set. This clever trick effectively pairs up each transformer sub-block weight. Using this, all the DINOv2 weights should get loaded. The function finally prints how many total weights were loaded out of the model’s total. If designed correctly, it should report nearly 100% (except possibly the positional embedding, see below).

In summary, `apply_improved_mapping` is a good function that should be kept and used as the primary weight-loading mechanism. It addresses the key mapping problems. One minor caveat: the suffix matching approach is a bit heuristic – it assumes no other distinct model weights share the same trailing name – but in practice this is fine (the DINO block weights have unique combos like “norm1.weight”, “mlp.fc2.bias”, etc., which won’t collide with non-DINO weights). A more deterministic fix would be to explicitly insert the “.0” in block keys (like the fixed adapter does) rather than relying on suffix pattern, but ultimately the result is the same. The improved adapter could be enhanced slightly (see Recommendations), but it’s the best of the lot so far.

### 5. Fixed Weight Adapter (`apply_fixed_mapping`)

**Assessment:** The fixed adapter attempts a more direct fix for DINO’s block naming. Its two-step process is logical: first run `fix_dino_block_structure` on the raw checkpoint dict to insert “.0” after every `encoder.dino.blocks.X` occurrence, then proceed with regex mappings for `matcher.model.encoder.*`, etc., and load the weights. This would perfectly solve the block indexing mismatch if the checkpoint already had `encoder.dino.*` keys. However, this reveals a flaw: in the raw MatchAnything checkpoint, the DINO weights are under `matcher.model.decoder.embedding_decoder.*`, not `encoder.dino.*`. The `fix_dino_block_structure` function as written only looks at keys starting with 'encoder.dino.blocks.' – which in the raw checkpoint is none. In other words, if you feed the original checkpoint directly to `apply_fixed_mapping`, the block fix step does nothing (since it won’t find any keys matching that pattern). Then the regex rules map `matcher.model.decoder.*` to `matcher.*`, so all DINO keys become `matcher.embedding_decoder.*` (with the `embedding_decoder` prefix still there, now under `matcher.`). They never get mapped to `encoder.dino` at all (because unlike the improved adapter, the fixed adapter’s regex list does not include a rule for `embedding_decoder` specifically). As a result, `apply_fixed_mapping` would end up loading the CNN and some matcher weights, but still miss all DINO weights – unless the checkpoint had been modified beforehand to label DINO keys with `encoder.dino`.

And in fact, that’s how it was intended to be used: the fixed adapter’s example suggests loading from an “adapted_dino” checkpoint. The `fix_dino_quick.py` script creates such a checkpoint (`matchanything_roma_adapted_dino.ckpt`) where every DINO weight from the official model is inserted with an `encoder.dino.` prefix. If one runs `apply_fixed_mapping` on that combined checkpoint, here’s what happens:

- Now the checkpoint does have many keys like `encoder.dino.blocks.X.attn...` from the inserted DINO weights. `fix_dino_block_structure` will find those and add the “.0” in each, fixing the names. It prints each change (e.g. “Fixed block structure: encoder.dino.blocks.5.attn.proj.weight -> encoder.dino.blocks.5.0.attn.proj.weight”).
- It also still has the original keys (like `matcher.model.encoder.cnn.*` and `matcher.model.decoder.embedding_decoder.blocks.X.*`), plus it now has DINO’s patch_embed, pos_embed, etc. under `encoder.dino.` from the merge. The regex rules will map the CNN and matcher keys appropriately. The `embedding_decoder.blocks` keys from the original will become `matcher.blocks.*` (and remain unused since model expects them under `encoder.dino`), but the merged DINO keys are now properly named (after the fix step). So those get mapped/truncated to `encoder.dino.*` (they were already prefixed correctly, and the mapping rules don’t alter `encoder.dino`). Thus, after mapping, the `mapped_dict` contains valid keys for all of DINO (with blocks X.0.Y) and for the CNN and matcher. Loading that into the model will succeed for most weights, as reflected in the printed results.

In short, the fixed adapter can work but only in conjunction with the external merging step. By itself on the original checkpoint, it’s incomplete. This makes it a bit clunky compared to the improved adapter which did everything in code without needing to create a new checkpoint file. Therefore, I would classify `apply_fixed_mapping` as somewhat redundant given we have a pure-Python solution (`apply_improved_mapping`). The idea of explicitly fixing the block names is good (and arguably safer than heuristic suffix matching), but it should be integrated into the main loading function rather than requiring a separate pre-processing of the checkpoint.

### 6. Checkpoint Merging Scripts (`create_hybrid_checkpoint.py` and `fix_dino_quick.py`)

Both of these scripts exist to address the same core problem – misalignment of DINOv2 weights – by creating a new checkpoint that “just works.” They are not needed in an ideal pipeline, but they’re worth evaluating:

- **`fix_dino_quick.py`**: This is a brute-force solution: throw in all DINOv2 weights with the `encoder.dino.` prefix and save. Its virtue is simplicity – it guarantees that the resulting checkpoint has every single DINO parameter (so nothing will be missing). However, it overwrites nothing from the original. For example, the original checkpoint’s DINO backbone weights (under `embedding_decoder`) remain in the file, just unused. Also, crucially, it does no shape or structure adaptation. If used directly for loading, you’d still have the block index mismatch (all keys like `encoder.dino.blocks.X.attn.weight` would not match the model expecting an extra level). Thus this script relies on using the fixed adapter afterward to clean up those names. As a result, `fix_dino_quick.py` by itself is not a complete fix – it’s a preparatory step. It’s also somewhat redundant now that we prefer not to create intermediate checkpoint files. (If we needed to merge DINO weights, the hybrid approach does it with more finesse, or we could load via code without saving an extra file.) Unless there’s a desire to maintain a fully combined `.ckpt` for other purposes, this quick script can be retired in favor of on-the-fly loading.
- **`create_hybrid_checkpoint.py`**: This is a more nuanced and purposeful merge. It recognizes that the original checkpoint already contains the transformer block weights from DINOv2 (likely fine-tuned or at least integrated in training), so it preserves those and does not blindly overwrite them with the generic DINOv2 ones. What it does is add the “essential” DINO components that might be missing or mismatched: the input patch projection and class/positional embeddings. It adapts the positional embedding shape properly, which is a big plus – this ensures the ViT’s pos embedding fits the model’s expected sequence length (197 tokens). It also adapts the patch projection if needed (in the code, resizing a 14×14 kernel to 16×16 – likely because the ViT was pre-trained with a 14×14 patch embed convolution but the model might treat it slightly differently). Another smart move: it takes the original transformer block weights (the bulk of DINOv2) and renames them in the state dict to the correct format (inserting the missing “.0” in block keys). So the resulting hybrid checkpoint has two sets of DINO backbone weights: one under the original names and one under the new names. When loaded into the model (with `strict=False`), the new names are consumed and the old names are ignored as unexpected – effectively, we have succeeded in loading everything. The script’s test shows a near 100% weight match, especially for DINO weights.

In terms of function, `create_hybrid_checkpoint.py` is good – it achieves the goal of fully populating the model weights. Its output “hybrid” checkpoint can be used with the basic `remap_and_load` (since it already contains correctly named keys for everything). However, as a workflow, it’s a bit convoluted to generate a new checkpoint file just to load a model. It duplicates a lot of data and requires maintaining multiple weight files (original, hybrid, maybe complete). Ideally, we prefer to load directly from the original checkpoint within code, without this detour. The hybrid script was likely created as a debugging aid or for one-off use. Going forward, we should incorporate its insights (positional embedding resizing, block renaming) into our unified weight-loading procedure. Thus, `create_hybrid_checkpoint.py` can be deprecated in favor of an integrated solution, though we should carry over its fixes.

## Key Issue: Why Weights Weren’t Loaded (DINOv2 Integration)

Before giving final recommendations, it’s important to understand the root cause of the missing weights and how the model architecture expects them:

- **MatchAnything’s “ROMA” model architecture**: The MatchAnything paper (2025) introduced a universal image matcher. The variant “matchanything_roma” refers to leveraging the RoMa: Robust Dense Feature Matching approach (CVPR 2024), which uses a pre-trained DINOv2 ViT-large/14 as the coarse feature encoder, combined with a CNN for fine features and a matching head. In RoMa, DINOv2’s transformer is used (often frozen) to produce coarse dense descriptors, and a small convolutional network refines local details. The MatchAnything authors integrated this idea, so inside the MatchAnything model checkpoint:
  - The DINOv2 ViT is encapsulated in the module often labeled `embedding_decoder` (since in their code it likely served as a “decoder” to produce a dense descriptor map). Indeed, the checkpoint contains many keys with `embedding_decoder.blocks.X.*`, confirming the ViT’s presence.
  - The “CNN encoder” provides fine features (likely a ResNet or similar, outputting high-res feature maps).
  - The “matcher” (maybe GPMatcher in code) takes the coarse and fine features to produce correspondences.

Thus, DINOv2’s weights must be loaded to reproduce the published results – leaving them random will break the model. The DINOv2 ViT-L/14 has ~44 Transformer blocks, each comprising self-attn and MLP sub-layers, and crucial parameters like the patch embedding projection and positional embeddings. The key mismatches encountered were:

- **Key naming**: In the MatchAnything checkpoint, all ViT weights have the prefix `matcher.model.decoder.embedding_decoder.` (reflecting how the training code was structured). Our TensorRT model expects them under `encoder.dino.` (since `CNNandDinov2TRT` likely defines an `encoder.dino` sub-module for the ViT). This required a prefix change which the improved adapter now handles. However, within the block names, the MatchAnything checkpoint uses the standard nomenclature from training (e.g., `blocks.0.attn.qkv.weight` if they directly saved the timm model’s state_dict). Our model’s `CNNandDinov2TRT` might represent each Transformer block as a nested module list, causing an extra index level (e.g., `blocks.0.0.qkv.weight`). This is why an inserted “.0” was needed for every block’s sub-structures. This nuance was easy to miss and was the primary reason so many weights didn’t load until we accounted for it.
- **Positional Embedding shape**: DINOv2 was pre-trained at 518×518 resolution, which yields a $37 \times 37 = 1369$ spatial patch grid plus 1 CLS token = 1370 token positions. The MatchAnything model likely uses images of size 832 (or at least treats the ViT with a 14px patch, giving a 60×60 grid for 832px – but they may not use all that in a single pos embed vector). In any case, the timm DINOv2 model’s `pos_embed` in the checkpoint would be `[1,1370,1024]`. If our `CNNandDinov2TRT` is instantiated for a base resolution of 224 (14×14 patches) or dynamic resizing, it might expect `[1,197,1024]` in the state dict. Indeed, the hybrid script explicitly converts the 1370-length `pos_embed` to 197-length. If we do not handle this, a direct load will skip the `pos_embed` due to shape mismatch. That could lead to the ONNX model having an uninitialized `pos_embed` or a default-initialized one, affecting performance. (Note: some frameworks interpolate pos embeddings at runtime for arbitrary input, but to be safe we prefer to load a correctly sized one).
- **Mask token**: DINOv2 ViT may have a `mask_token` parameter (for masked modeling). The hybrid script adds it as well. If the model expects it, we should supply it, although leaving it random might not impact matching if it’s unused at inference. Still, it’s best to include it from the official weights.

Given all these, the small ONNX file was a direct consequence of most of DINOv2’s ~330M parameters not being loaded. The TensorRT conversion script did enable external data: indeed, after export it notes “keep both .onnx and .onnx.data files together”. So the tiny .onnx file seen was likely just the graph, with an `.onnx.data` file holding weights. The fact that even the combined size was small means the weights themselves were mostly not present (either not loaded or constant-folded away). With proper weight loading, we expect the ONNX’s data file to be on the order of a few hundred MB (reflecting the full ViT weights).

## Recommendations and Fixes

Based on the above, we recommend a unified, robust conversion approach with fewer scripts:

1. **Consolidate Weight Loading – use the Improved Adapter (integrated with block fix and pos embed handling).** All the weight-mapping logic should be merged into a single function or small module that is invoked during ONNX export. The `apply_improved_mapping` function is a strong foundation. We suggest:
   - Use `apply_improved_mapping` as the default loader in `export_accurate_matchanything_onnx` (replace the old `remap_and_load` call). This will immediately map the majority of the weights correctly (CNN, matcher, DINO backbone). The suffix matching will resolve the block index issue in code (no external file needed). You should see a console print confirming near 100% of weights loaded (e.g. “Final result: 350/350 weights loaded”). This ensures the DINOv2 backbone is populated, which is crucial for correct ONNX output.
   - Enhance `apply_improved_mapping` with a deterministic block fix (optional): To avoid relying purely on suffix matching, you could incorporate the block structure fix directly. For example, after creating `mapped_weights`, scan for keys of the form `encoder.dino.blocks.<n>.{attn,mlp,norm}` and if the model’s state_dict expects an extra “.0.”, insert it. This can be done similarly to `fix_dino_block_structure()` but operating on the already mapped dict. This way, keys align exactly and load via direct matching. (This is an optional safety; the current suffix approach has worked, but explicit mapping is cleaner.)
   - **Positional Embedding:** Ensure the ViT positional embedding is correctly loaded or adjusted. Two scenarios:
     - If the model’s `CNNandDinov2TRT` uses a timm DINO model internally: It might automatically interpolate `pos_embed` for the given input size on forward. In that case, the state_dict might expect the original 1370-length `pos_embed` (since the model might store the pretrain `pos_embed` and do runtime interpolate). If so, our improved loader would load the 1370-length from the checkpoint just fine (since model expects 1370, checkpoint provides 1370). But if instead the model was built with a 14×14 base (197 length) `pos_embed` (perhaps they initialized it for 224 and rely on external resizing for bigger inputs), then our loader will currently skip the checkpoint’s `pos_embed` (shape mismatch). We should handle this. We can adopt the solution from `create_hybrid_checkpoint.py`: detect if checkpoint `pos_embed` is length 1370 while model’s is 197 (or any mismatch in spatial length), and perform the interpolation to resize it. We have the code for that: take the 1369 spatial tokens, reshape to 37×37, interpolate to 14×14 (for 224px base), then reshape back. This yields a `[1,197,1024]` tensor which we can load. Doing this inside the Python loading (before or after mapping) will ensure `pos_embed` weight is included. This is important for matching performance. Alternatively, one could load the checkpoint `pos_embed` as-is (as an unexpected key) and rely on the model’s forward to interpolate if implemented. But for ONNX export, it’s safer to have the correct size baked in as a constant.
     - Also load `cls_token` and `mask_token` properly: The checkpoint likely has them inside the `embedding_decoder` state (often ViT stores `cls_token` as part of `pos_embed` or separately). If the original checkpoint didn’t have a `mask_token` (maybe they never did masked training), the model might have one initialized. The hybrid script added it from official weights just in case. We can similarly get it from the official DINO or simply leave the model’s default if not critical. For completeness, consider using `timm.create_model('vit_large_patch14_dinov2', pretrained=True)` inside the loader to grab `pos_embed`, `cls_token`, `mask_token` if the checkpoint is missing them or if interpolation is needed. (This does add a dependency on `timm` at conversion time, but the hybrid script already uses it – ensure `timm` is in the environment.)
   - **Diagnostics:** Keep the verbose prints (from better/improved adapter) in the unified loader. They are useful to confirm all weights load. For example, after loading, it should print `[SUCCESS] Loaded X weight tensors` or an equivalent summary with missing count. Ideally, missing should be 0 or minimal. If any `encoder.dino` keys are still missing, that indicates something unhandled (e.g., if we forgot `pos_embed`). With our fixes, this should drop to zero.

   Using this unified improved loader will resolve the weight inclusion issue. The ONNX export will then include the full DINOv2 backbone weights. Expect the `.onnx.data` file to be large (hundreds of MB). The TensorRT engine generated from it will likewise be large and should yield accurate matching results on par with the original model.

2. **Simplify the script set – remove redundant ones:** With the above loader in place, many of the extra scripts become unnecessary:
   - Discard `better_weight_adapter.py` and `checkpoint_adapted_model.py`: their diagnostic value has been folded into the improved loader. They don’t need to be called separately now. (You might keep them in version control history, but they need not ship with the final conversion tool.)
   - Discard `fix_dino_quick.py`: we will no longer need to produce a “complete” checkpoint file externally. Loading official DINO weights on the fly (if needed) is cleaner. Moreover, blindly merging all weights is risky – for instance, if the original checkpoint had fine-tuned some DINO weights, you wouldn’t want to overwrite them with pre-trained ones. Our improved loader approach respects the original weights fully.
   - Possibly discard `fixed_weight_adapter.py`: If we integrate block fixing into the improved loader, the fixed adapter is superseded. It was mainly an alternative approach. Unless you want to keep it as a fallback, it can be removed to avoid confusion. (If you do keep it, clearly document that it’s meant for use with a specially merged checkpoint and not the original – but again, that merged path is not needed anymore.)
   - Retain for reference (or remove) `create_hybrid_checkpoint.py`: This script’s functionality is largely covered by the new process. You no longer need to generate a hybrid file as a separate step. We have borrowed its techniques (pos_embed and block renaming) into our loader. Thus, in principle, you can retire this script as well. However, you might keep it in a dev/ folder or as a commented-out utility in case someone wants to manually inspect or create a checkpoint for debugging. If kept, mark it as optional/diagnostic. Otherwise, remove it to streamline the repo.

3. **Validate the conversion with full weights:** After implementing the above, run the ONNX export again with the MatchAnything checkpoint. The log should indicate that all or nearly all weights were loaded. Check the size of the ONNX `.data` file – it should be much larger now (reflecting ~330M parameters of DINOv2). Also consider doing a quick sanity check on the outputs. For example, run the TensorRT engine on a pair of images and compare the matches to those from the original PyTorch model or the HuggingFace demo. They should match closely if all weights and thresholds are correctly in place. This will confirm that inference accuracy is restored.

4. **Address any remaining pitfalls noted in the markdowns:** A few additional points from the repository documentation to keep in mind:
   - Dynamic image shapes: The improved build script already ensures the min/opt/max shapes are multiples of 14, which is necessary because the ViT patch embedding works on 14px patches. This is a good practice to keep – it prevents issues where an odd input dimension could lead to a different number of patches and mismatch the positional embeddings. Continue to enforce that, or at least document that inputs should be appropriately sized (the original MatchAnything likely also had similar constraints).
   - FP16 Precision: The script allows FP16 mode. Once weights load properly in FP32, FP16 conversion should work as well (with truncation during TRT build). Just be sure to test that there is no overflow or precision issue introduced in DINO’s attention layers – typically it’s fine, but large dot-products can sometimes benefit from FP32 accumulation. Monitor the engine’s output for any obvious degradation in match quality under FP16. If issues arise, one might keep certain submodules in FP32, but that’s beyond our scope unless observed.
   - Memory: A fully loaded ViT-L/14 will make the ONNX quite large (>1GB). TensorRT will then consume a lot of memory for the engine. The workspace size was set to 4096 MB which is usually okay, but if it fails, you might need to increase it or allow a lower optimization level. The logs should guide this. The user should be aware that the final engine is heavy – that’s expected given the model’s size.
   - Inference wrapper: The `AccurateMatchAnythingWrapper` in the code ensures the output format matches the original (with keys `mkpts0_f`, etc.). That’s fine. Just ensure that when you deploy the TensorRT engine, you replicate any postprocessing (like scaling coordinates by 16 as done in the model) so that the final outputs align with expectations.

5. **Document and comment the changes:** In the code, clearly comment why certain mappings are done, e.g.: “Map `embedding_decoder` to `encoder.dino` because the MatchAnything checkpoint uses `embedding_decoder` for the DINOv2 ViT (see MatchAnything paper and RoMa). Insert index ‘0’ in transformer block keys to match model architecture. Resize `pos_embed` from 37×37 grid to 14×14 because DINOv2 was pre-trained at 518px (37 patches), whereas we use 224px (14 patches) resolution for embedding.” These notes ensure future maintainers or users understand the reasoning, which was rooted in the official model designs.

By following these recommendations, the exported ONNX will contain all the weights from `matchanything_roma.ckpt` (and any supplemental DINO weights needed), yielding a much larger and correct file. The TensorRT engine built from it will be able to perform accurate cross-modal matching as reported in the MatchAnything paper. In essence, we are keeping the crucial components (`accurate_matchanything_trt.py` and the improved weight-loading logic) and eliminating the trial-and-error scripts. The final conversion pipeline will load the original checkpoint fully, export to ONNX, and build the engine in one smooth process.

Once this is implemented, the ONNX size should increase to the expected range (matching the model’s parameter count) and the matching results should align with those from the original PyTorch model – resolving the core issue.
